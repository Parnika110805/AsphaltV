# VisionScan – Fleet Consensus Road Risk Intelligence

VisionScan is an AI-powered smart city system that detects and validates road defects using multi-fleet consensus to improve trust and prioritization.

## Problem
Cities rely on manual complaints or single-source detection, leading to unreliable road maintenance decisions.

## Solution
VisionScan uses computer vision to detect road defects and validates them only when confirmed by multiple independent fleets.

## Features
- AI-based pothole detection (YOLO)
- Geo-tagged defect reports
- Multi-fleet consensus validation
- Municipal dashboard visualization
- Privacy-preserving design

## Tech Stack
- Python, Flask
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- Supabase
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Leaflet.js

## Status
Hackathon MVP (Work in Progress)
